Some companies will take you on with training rather than the degree! Maybe look for that route?
And I'm having a detox from foundation and makeup is effort.

@Mikkeltron I never played the first one. Not a fan of zombie type enemies. I'm a big wimp 😂

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I fail to see how you think a choice is equal to killing the elderly. Involuntary euthanasia isn't a thing. That's just murder. But then the choice to be euthanised isn't there either so maybe you should think about that cause first?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Wait I thought you said an unborn foetus was a person too? Isn't that three? Sacarsm.
Their lives have not begun yet

Also
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Somehow I think all the kids in care
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews So women deserve for their lives to be ruined by a child they did not want
I think most women would prefer the choice. They don't have to take it
@_HarriRose 😘😘😘
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews We are going round in circles love. I would rather have the choice to terminate a pregnancy that I do not want
@MadHatterJimmy Yeah I'm planning on a Corsair keyboard. And yeah I use my laptop screen when streaming. Again this screen is borrowed
@MadHatterJimmy Lol god no.
@MadHatterJimmy The headset was a present
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Whether it is likely or not those few women should be given the choice. And seeing as I live in England
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Intestines are developed outside the body and twist in. Definitely not all in place by then. There's no use in an undeveloped lung. It's like saying uncooked chicken is still suitable to eat. And what about protection from an abusive family due to being born of rape/force?

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby... It would poison the mother if it wasn't removed.
And so the mother
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I think you best read up a little more. Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy. https://t.co/Wf2zVOopJM
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Contraception isn't 100% effective. Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. 
But you'll risk the well-being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked? It doesn't have the organs to survive alone...
@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews I'm sorry you had to go through that. The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman.
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Thanks for informing me on how a human is created... But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks. That is no life. 

I suppose you're someone who believes contraception is wrong too?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Yet women aren't all given help. You're not killing a baby... It's not alive until it is born
Let women make their own choice about their bodies...
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews What about a mother who was raped
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I'm not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn. It happens so often. -_- since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own?
@miliszan Thank you sweet. I keep being relieved I'm not but sad I'm not 😂
@xmako_eyesx That's true. I probably would end up collapsing and without Grant to help me and notice when I'm going I would probably freak a bunch of people out! 😂
Tho when my mum asked me if I was going I kinda felt sad. I haven't missed MCM May in years.

@inannamute @_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB This thread 👌 honestly I've represented a few companies through my cosplay in the past and either they never seemed to work out very professionally or I'd end up chasing for info from someone who's 'disappeared'
@_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB Ahh I guess that's true. Coming from a cosplay community into the more gaming focused streaming community etc it's difficult to gauge how it all goes down. I personally would still feel weird going to a company asking for a sponsor (but then I am new 😂)
@_JacobTheBear_ @AdamGCB I've been told to contact people about sponsorships but feel if I were to do that it comes across entitled and rude? If a company wants to sponsor a 'content creator'

@isdatbun @Apollocosplay In the kinda person that in the right mood I will properly defend (I punched a dude once for harrassing a girl at a festival) but some days I just don't have that in me. Plus fear of being kicked out because they're security... We're just customers.
@Apollocosplay @isdatbun At MCM London in October not Brum but it does seem to be a recurring issue.
@Apollocosplay @isdatbun I witnessed 2 security guards going behind a latex cosplayer taking a photo then go off to show another guard... I walked past them told them they were disgusting. Too afraid to do anything else.

@SaintSpartan03 Just wanting to see what would be the 2nd option in case I have to abandon Fortnite for the night lol
@SaintSpartan03 They did a bunch of background things and it's been down most of the day. Meaning that the wait times this evening might be crazy long.
Might stream something else other than Fortnite tonight as they've been updating the game most of today but the wait times if it comes back up may be ludicrous. 

Any other suggestions?

@SaintSpartan03 Thanks man 💙 I've kinda felt like this since London MCM tbh. I didn't expect to still feel low almost 3 months later :/ Twitch has helped me feel a bit more human but still can't get over the original low y'know :/
It's literally making me want to cancel my patreon and kofi and twitch and not go to any cons. I literally feel like I'm at rock bottom. If I can't like my own stuff
My enthusiasm for cosplay has really gone out the window recently. Like I just looked at the overcoat for Gentiana and thought
@StephanieJayneK Woah what a Dick move. Hope you're okay sweet 💙 (if it's any consolation my nan said I ruined my body with my tattoo)

@louisejulie_ You're even more prepared than me haha
@louisejulie_ What were you planning on shooting?
@LouJM_ Oh same. Cosplay as much as I love it often makes me feel inadequate and pathetic. My body confidence drops so dramatically after I get photos back. But it also goes the other way too. Making me feel bloody brilliant.
@LouJM_ Please don't. Cosplay photos need to stay cause they show how much you improve as a cosplayer and a person. I know what you're feeling but don't give up 💙
Happy anniversary @FFXVEN !!
The first Final Fantasy game I ever played
Thank you for the memories and cosplay!

@marsbarbarbar For the docs I mean
@marsbarbarbar I'm not on any medication 😂 it's literally out of the blue. I don't want to go to the docs if it's just a migraine. That's a waste of time.
@marsbarbarbar True. But it's not like Twitter was the first thing I went to to find info...
@marsbarbarbar Thing is I've lost faith a bit due to my back. If it's something docs can see they'll fix

@NUH__XD @DaxDoesShit @Mikasacus Ah I didn't know you were joking lol I agree with you with lyn being a good character and my not be optimal as a unit but can do some niche strats and her mani katti is basically rapier 2.0 since she's force deploy on the last chapter might as well use her to contribute there
@DaxDoesShit @NUH__XD @Mikasacus You count the royal families as lords? Ehh I guess? I prefer lyn because of he character and thighs it's a shame that she's not much a part of the game storywise. I think Camilla is alrightish characterwise

HEY GUYS FYI I'VE TAKEN ART HISTORY AND BUDDHIST LITERATURE CLASSES AT UNI.

PLEASE CLAP.
this concept of an imperfect
some examples of wabi-sabi in zen  ☸️🗾: https://t.co/zLGTaPTtnT
It is a process of silencing the mind and thus removing the suffering of your own condition
"zen buddhism also has a concept I really like known as ""wabi-sabi"". it is the embrace of the ephemeral nature of all things and the imperfections of the human experience. enlightenment doesn't mean you're suddenly infallible"
you see this a lot in zen buddhism. there is an effort or lack thereof
this is sort of the nature of the phenomenon of the epiphany. it is a momentary grasp of a lucid
It is only when we become attached to expectations or external conceptions that by nature limit us or make us smaller that we slip out of that enlightenment. In that sense it is something you can slip in and out of. If all we have is the present
I forgot which sect(s) it is but in some form of Buddhism ☸️ there is the idea that everyone -- by default -- is already a buddha
⚕🆙 https://t.co/yBTPgsgPHb
https://t.co/kspTz9M8wj
https://t.co/u1ZyKQOBWY
"if you just see ""god"" as everything both within u and in relation to u as opposed to an omnipresent external judge this becomes a lot easier to process"
it's not that there was a specific person with a divine experience it's that we collectively chose to reinforce that idea and maintain it long enough over the course of history for it to be normalized.
Or idk that's just an idea. I mean think of how we give religious iconography strength and how faith and perceived cause-effect connections strengthen the impact of those religions.... 🤔
If we live in a world of mental energy and symbols and internalization
pls retweet https://t.co/1TMMY81mh8
I was in much more of a flow then so my transcendent subjective reality began to overlap more with the more mundane objective reality. It seems like whatever mass hysteria I sensed then had kind of died down a bit.
I gotta say my external reality certainly has changed significantly since I started posting again in Fall
maybe I'll just continue to subversively divert the ontological norms enough until my external reality presents me with a system that doesn't feel so stacked against me
do you ever think you might actually be more successful being a cult leader than actually getting the career of your dreams?

I think that the accelerated access and absorbtion of information has had a significant impact on specialization

coming to terms with ones own redundancy and obsolescence is harder than coming to terms with your mortality

I honestly think the main motivating factor is that people like having the power using language and cultural norms to completely destroy someone. They love the suffering. They even love the suffering caused to the person's friends and loved ones.

These are not good people.
there's a difference between preventing a legitimately problematic person from having a platform and combing through a person's worst moments because you have a sociopathic desire for revenge against people you don't like
"the majority of what an ""activist"" spends their emotional energy on feeding into online says a lot more about their character than what they claim to stand for. these people are chumps and they maintain the 24 hour news cycle of shit. destroy them."
Not everyone has to be fired for [offensive thing]. Theres no moral obligation or imperative

Historical revisionism. Plain and simple. The more we recognize propaganda as legitimate the more we're changing the legacy of American imperialism by absolving and softening crimes against humanity. It's appalling and more people should be upset.
We're trying to give war criminals the benefit of the doubt with retroactive praise via the mainstream media. You see it with the Bush family
RT @chomsky_quotes: One fundamental goal of any well-crafted indoctrination program is to direct attention elsewhere
Also why the fuck are we giving Obama a netflix series? We willingly lose paradise more and more every year. Why is HBO releasing a propaganda documentary on McCain just as he's about to croak? Does this not seem weird to anyone else?
Think of the impact technology and mass entertainment has had on re-wiring the brains of gen z. They live in a fundamentally warped view of the world.
Stop making shitty people famous. Stop making fame seem more important than it is. Reinstill the values that promote a healthy family unit or we'll continue to have parents who raise fuck up reactionary failchildren who resort to murder for attention.
In a world where sociopaths aren't given attention they'd rather take a legacy of infamy than no legacy at all. And honestly given how the media chooses to cover and oversaturate certain stories we really have no one but ourselves to blame. It's a byproduct of consumer culture.
honestly I think we have the media and entertainment culture to blame for the current political climate and to a large extent the school shooter epidemic. give attention to the wrong things

Manufactured outrage. Performative righteousness. Educated white people speaking on behalf of others. The liberal arts became so politicized in the worst ways at the expense of exploration
It's important how you frame an issue or how society has set the discourse on how to debate/discuss it
I think shifts in narrative are often more disgusting than the issues those narratives represent
It's not so much abortion itself that irks me
"how did we go from ""abortion is a woman's choice"" to ""if I could have an abortion I would"" or ""yeah"
Morally bankrupt individuals that lot
I can understand wanting to distance yourself from Catholicism but to mock nature and spirit in the name of narcissistic hedonism

I don't know how anyone can have the arrogance to see themselves as above nature or the forces beyond our perception
My buddhism shares aspects with agnosticism in the sense of an unknown regarding God but fucking hell I generally hate atheists
I'm relatively neutral on the 8th amendment thing but god damn does it bring the worst out of people (left and right)

I wouldn't really consider myself a neo-luddite but I think we have reached a point in history where further technological advances have far more sinister applications which serve to further class disparity rather than to resolve fundamental global issues
1 issue I have with the suggestion that technological advancements are analogous to societal 'progress' is often that the zealotry of technocrats has us diving into realms of the dark and unknown faster than we can assess the psychological and sociological effects of that novelty
I'm not sure people have assessed the extent and consequences of hyperbranding and the market of self

2018: Hipster neurotypicals disregarding context for performative in-group brownie points and self-aggrandizement
The people who are denoted as geniuses by contemporary society are often given that status after that person has already become successful via either business or academia. It's retroactive. Clout. A reflection of that person's perceived success. Completely different.
I'd say that capitalism doesn't reward genius
It also suggests that genius is a product of society or history and not of the mind of an individual. How society perceives or ranks a figure has nothing to do with that individual's objective ability. https://t.co/Dn7lmA0NYh
All of these arguments are pulled out of thin air and poorly explained. Rubbish. No scientific or historical context whatsoever. Perfectly illustrates the myopia of the current culture. We've accelerated so much these clowns can't remember life before 2016.

Its a lot easier to process &amp; understand an experience someone else is describing if u have already experienced it. It's also a lot more intuitive if that's the case. And I've experienced things that over 95% of people never will. There will always be that phenomenological lacuna
a lot of people don't understand the spiritual concept of surrender or what it entails or how it unfolds in the greater process of awakening

See yourself more as a vessel and less as a self.
Also a lot of people don't trust their intuition enough. They'll stay in a toxic place or with toxic people despite that being a huge factor in feeling distressed. It takes courage to listen to your mind and body and follow through
I'm more content now than I probably have ever been because most external factors don't phase me like they used to. The energy I'm not wasting ruminating or worrying about a self in some competitive psychodrama has kept me in a creative flow
"There's a difference between ""following your dreams"" for external fulfillment or material gain and being content with yourself and your own unfolding. Lot of people spiritually bankrupt"

This is one problem with giving the authority for primary sources to very select publications because these publications will abuse that power to write history as they see fit. This is a fundamental problem with historicity
Keep this in mind when you see the NYT
the NYT plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world on the part of the politically active educated classes...and I believe that NYT editors bear a heavy burden in the sense that the NYT creates history - Noam Chomsky

https://t.co/opNr1ONrUU
Isnt it a bit odd that the media &amp; oafish elites threw a bigger fit about Michelle Wolf's correspondence dinner speech than literally any of the war escalation and massacres of Palestinians in the past several weeks? We need a revolution in journalism.
My grammar was all over the place in those tweets but I hope what I said made sense
How much do you see Trump being used as a target instead of legitimately more terrifying tactics used by the GOP like ramping up ICE

https://t.co/6x3StGagxh
It's not so much that Trump is that paper tiger it's that the media focuses so much on trivial one upsmanship. Liberals care more about proving everyone else wrong with an elitist mentality than actually doing anything to combat the looming spectre of fascism
If they have a paper tiger they can always prop up to distract from whats going on behind the scenes. You see time and time again in American history fear in conjunction with the media used to create artificial antagonism and diversion
Then again I am still shocked daily by how ignorant and gullible the American public is

The cyclical nature of addiction and mental illness is really sad
This was back in like 2012/13 btw when I was off the rails
So it went almost from a compulsion to just a normal extension of my character. Empathy is good.
It sorta started when I had mania and would walk around at like 3 in the morning in sketchy areas of downtown but I really don't mind talking to or even chilling for a bit with homeless people. They are a lot more wise than people realize
Well that was kind of a weird experience but I'm glad I stuck around to talk to the guy. It's really hard for the homeless especially in Seattle

@3hrist Lol not yet. I'm just bored and wilin. Thanks for the reminder tho. Think I'll do that now
Until you see the sorts of online communities these types of intersectional libs and commies flock to u have no idea how warped their view of reality is and how damaging it is for them. Sure they might have good taste in memes or be smarter than average
lol yup

https://t.co/QypV4M8gGe https://t.co/z85j8orxUW
Plus a lot of them are delusional bandwagon commies it's so annoying
If you think PC culture or SJW bashing is overblown go to any cool freaks group on Facebook. It's a  gulag for white guilt
Seriously fuck cool freaks.jpg and cool freaks wikipedia club. Bunch of shitlib psychopath bullies masquerading as oppressed freedom fighters. Awful
"I think gay people are chill I just don't like the idea of ""the LGBT community"" being this monolithic thing with a political agenda that prescribes specific principles. Plus echo chamber SJW communities like ""cool freaks"" on Facebook really shone a light on toxicity in that realm"
*nervously deflecting perceived reputation of homophobia*
Speaking of gay people who are entertaining and funny

He has a wiki page now that's so cool. I remember reading his rough draft scripts and now one of them is a full length film

https://t.co/VIb9klOuST
I feel like there's sorta a horseshoe theory for sassy gay men where they're either insufferable or hilariously entertaining. Rarely a middle ground
I missed two shows of musicians who are friends or friends of friends this past week due to organizational issues/not getting notified on FB. I need like a physical 📅📆 so my friends realize I still support their music/comedy 😑😕😢

I mean romanticism itself is already a completely flawed way of approaching love. I honestly think a pretty solid chunk of people &lt;25 don't know what love really is
Girls really need to detach and separate romanticism from sexual liberation. Sex and love are so different

But instead people see something
It's okay to like actually call up your friends you know. Like catching up with them

Traditionalism isn't just nostalgia
The more we used postmodernist rationale to justify normalizing things that were just recently considered unthinkable the more we dug our own grave. And now we just slowly watch the house of cards crumble.
We're merely paying the consequences for the hubris of dumbing down and sexualizing pop culture you fucking greedy retards
Misogyny doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you don't think there have been shifts in sociology and culture that have ramped it up

Guys who literally choke and piss on girls calling them awful degrading things trying to take the high road with their navel gazing. Foh.
"And it's not even ""the bedroom"" anymore it's weird rape fantasies in sex dungeons. Please"
"Somehow in Western society we've detached ""the bedroom"" from every other aspect of life almost as if that isn't directly feeding into the rest of culture. It is. People are sick."
Somehow sexual abuse is cool if you're paid to do it and she's into it? But those very same people with masochist fetishes are radical leftist hardliners. Very contradictory logic for contemporary feminism IMO. 🙄
"there is so much contradictory weird Freudian shit going on with ""Daddy"" culture and intersectionalism. Pornography is almost inherently misogynistic and somehow we separate fetishes and taboo sexual activities from the rest of fodder for thinkpiece writers"
The end goal all ties back into a sort of totalitarian indoctrination that squashes dissent with conformity. It's basically like intersectionalism is cucking your rights away. I dread the next implementation phase of the new world order as it relates to freedom of speech
"I guarantee one of your favorite authors or artists in the last century did things far more ""problematic"" than today's media shitstorm culture but today we can't even frame discussions or pose questions in ways that might be seen as offensive"

And my anger always shifts to disappointment and pathos
Especially when you can stand back far enough from it all to see how time and time again it is their own arrogance and vanity that undermines them
Seeing people not grow or learn from mistakes despite being successful or making strides in other aspects of their lives is such a massive disappointment
Not even seeing their bad karma unfold in real time brings any sense of grim satisfaction or closure bc ultimately you realize they're the same person they were when they fucked you up. There's just a hollow separateness in which you see someone walking into a wall ad infinitum
Or they just plug their ears and go LALALALALALALA while whatever guilt they still have slowly festers inside them
Social media allows people to forget and move on so easily. Redemption doesn't even exist anymore and they all just hop from one botched relationship to another
and so all the catharsis from the night before evaporates like nothing ever happened

So uh
A lotta people also have to consider that Buddhism is rough. Like there is a lot of dark shit
When cancel culture and media propaganda is no longer the status quo (which will likely not happen for as long as MSM exists) then I may consider saying things more palatable and optimistically righteous or whatever
And you know
Again
Having said that I will still totally dunk on people or tear them to shreds if they abuse power or have shitty takes or make the web deliberately more fractured and toxic. Maybe that's just the nihilist vigilante in me idk. And yeah
However
I'd say I lean more towards criticizing culture
@ByYourLogic are there still hostages
If we can widen the range of discussion for our lively debate to occur in that's a pro in my book
I try to use humor to frame a lot of my more taboo opinions but I know for a fact a LOT of people don't get me or find me funny and I'm cool with that because that's the position of vulnerability you have to put yourself in to make a difference
I mean I hate cops. So there's that. I hate Israel. Tricky
I mean

I'm not really sure how I can frame my content lol.
You're perfectly free to disagree with me or call me a bigot but frankly I'm detached enough from my online persona for it to impact my day to day life. It's completely another thing if or as soon as my career enters the public sphere but idc my life is already in shambles
there are definitely a lot of shitty people with shady morals about but I still think the majority are just pretty normal people who are against mainstream bipartisanship and normie scum. I often due things to offend but primarily for the sake of widening a window of discussion
Even though I consider myself primarily a leftist anarchist I sometimes resonate more with certain alt-lite trolls than tankies you know what I mean
leftist twitter beef is such a joke lol. I have such a weak grasp on the political spectrum of most of the accounts I like. I follow a ton of people on here I disagree with significantly but I follow them because I think it's important to observe the gestalt of the discourse
really resonates with me for where I'm at in my artistic/literary path and the methods which I employ for expressing my ideas &amp; emotions

"@KevinShau I've found no evidence there is consensus that they are anywhere among the ""top living intellectuals"""
Check out some of these people that I've consistently found: Noam Chomsky
You know who gets real mad when you call the Right a bunch of racist old white dudes?

Racist old white dudes.
@KevinShau An argument we can have again
@KevinShau I think we remember that conversation very differently.  I quoted several lines of Peterson's and put them up against the data that corresponded
@KevinShau I'd be very quick to be wary on any stat with one source.  Given that I've attempted to include multiple articles with the same points on anything you have asked for sources on.
@KevinShau We had a very large debate about the Wage gap on Facebook
@KevinShau I would refer you back to my multiple tweets regarding how I do my research that include looking through sources such as Brietbart
@KevinShau You can skip the parts you find offensive
@KevinShau We have already had discussions of me breaking apart both Shapiro and Peterson's videos piece by piece.  We can do more of that
@KevinShau I do not follow a party
@KevinShau I did not see those interviews on his channel
TYT is a left wing Alex jones
@KevinShau Again
@KevinShau I think you do not understand the marketing piece here
@KevinShau I'm not planning to read an 80 year old
@KevinShau I was giving you multiple articles with confirmation of the question you asked.  I'm sorry you do not like the author's writing style.  Personally
@KevinShau Also
@KevinShau I'll give this a watch through today.  Regardless of how it plays out
"@KevinShau You should know pretty well that I break from the ""leftist"" mold quite frequently.  I do thorough research through multiple sources from both ""sides"""
@KevinShau I've watched hours of his lectures
I'm not intentionally condescending
@KevinShau The type of content in demand by people like Jones
@KevinShau Dave Rubin is opening on tour for Jordan Peterson and tweets about Peterson as a regular thing.  I also do not see any notable progressive or modern liberal people on his channel.  If you can not see and look past your own bias
@KevinShau I believe that the opinion of Pool's validity is going to be an irreconcilable difference here.  I've watched his videos and I see what they are compared to Journalists who win real awards
@KevinShau Trump denounced the KKK
@KevinShau Unnecessary
@KevinShau Fallacy of anecdotal evidence
@KevinShau https://t.co/crXHjpzjpB
@KevinShau https://t.co/csAHlNplmc
@KevinShau 2/2 One for you
https://t.co/4YCHPuexGH
@KevinShau 1/2: I'm worried that your claim for sources will result in your attempt to attack reputable news organizations instead of furthering discussion.
That being said:
@KevinShau You asked for sources in a second tweet
@KevinShau For instance:  Violent crime by illegal immigrants is a huge issue in this country.  Emotionally? That may seem agreeable to a lot of people.  Factually
@KevinShau Spoiler: That's the point.
"@KevinShau ""Data is objective"
I'm going to just let that sit there so you can just rethink that sentence. Think about that one REAL hard.
@KevinShau Thats because Peterson makes sure to debate reporters and students
@KevinShau I'm sorry you see it that way
@KevinShau If there is greater access
@KevinShau I'm aware of biases in media and I take my news from either the most direct point possible
@KevinShau You're not commenting on my point.  I'm not saying that CNN is right
@KevinShau I'll repeat:  All his fans are not alt-right
@KevinShau Just because I hate Kevin Spacey does not mean kevin spacey also hates me
@KevinShau Peterson also works in the same way the alt-right does
"@KevinShau Nobody I have seen is saying ""all his fans are alt-right"""
A lot of people are saying he has a very large alt-right fanbase
@KevinShau Regardless of Peterson's true feelings towards the alt-right
@KevinShau Dealing in facts is a much better way to get results. Dealing in opinions generally leads to emotional reactions over sensible reactions.
"@KevinShau I saw it was neck and neck with John Oliver's ""Marlon Bundo"" book for a while"
@KevinShau I'm not mischaracterizing Pool.  He said that Peterson does like like the alt-right
@KevinShau The only other self described news I had seen it done on was Jones
@KevinShau If someone somehow found that Vox article before any other information
@KevinShau I'm not characterizing
@KevinShau He's a pseudo-intellectual snake oil salesman.  I know I'm attacking him as a person
@KevinShau Pool
@KevinShau This is not journalism
@KevinShau 9/?
Pool so far has not shown any evidence the alt right doesn't like peterson(minus a quote from..peterson)
Also He did not even dismissed his OWN straw-man argument provided at the beginning of this video.
@KevinShau 8/?
"Pool earlier attacked the media for exageratting subscribers on youtube by saying ""thousands"" when in reality it is ""millions"".  He then goes back to say it is not millions.  (So at the least they are both idiots?)."
@KevinShau 7/?
Hold on
"@KevinShau 6/?  This is a 16 minute video and 10 minutes has been spent saying Peterson says he doesn't play identity politics"".  Pool made a point to say the alt-right doesnt like Peterson"
@KevinShau 5/?
"Also:  Pool keeps saying that ""Peterson denied being alt right meaning he doesn't have alt right fans"" but that is a logical fallacy in itself. Peterson can dislike the alt-right"
"@KevinShau 4/?He attacks the ""daily dot"" opinion article"
@KevinShau 3/?
"Pool criticizes an old video for saying Peterson has ""hundreds of thousands of followers"" on youtube when it is actually just over a million.  Seems nitpicky"
@KevinShau 2/?
Then he asked for money(is this alex jones?!).  Then he said that the alt-right couldn't love peterson
@KevinShau 1/?  I watched another one of Pool's videos:
Why is the media lying about Jordan Peterson(I thought it was relevant to the rest of this topic).
He starts out by creating a strawman argument that Peterson is aligning with facist organizations.
"@KevinShau ""Peterson himself said in his Channel 4 interview that 80 percent of his YouTube audience is male. These young men are upset about . .  the need to compete with women and minorities for jobs and spots at top universities"
@KevinShau Additionally
@KevinShau While I'm not in love with the source website

https://t.co/71Fx8cTKCH
"@KevinShau There is another LARGE difference between a ""unpopular"" position"
@KevinShau 3/3: Those letters also affirmed Peterson’s free speech rights and his right to academic freedom.
@KevinShau 2/3: One letter suggested that he could easily avoid contributing to discrimination by using a student’s first name
@KevinShau 1/3: That is avoiding the point that Peterson was upset at a bill for something the bill did not do.  Instead of targeting the code
@KevinShau I do not know his work
@KevinShau No
@KevinShau https://t.co/Hw0mt7pRCR
@KevinShau We have discussed this numerous times
@KevinShau I'm sure it would
@KevinShau There are plenty of experts in that field.  None of which have said that Women want to help muslims so they can be dominated.
Peterson is in the wrong here
"@KevinShau and ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination"" is not an interest or desire of an entire gender"
I'd argue if you browse craigslist
"@KevinShau There is a LARGE difference between saying not ""only great things"" and ""Sexist"
@KevinShau 3/2: Now to be fair
@KevinShau Not every piece that outs a fraud is a hit piece
Not to mention Peterson has *multiple times* touted his honorary tribal membership that does not exist
@KevinShau If you are trying to claim this man as a good journalist
@KevinShau I have to have some fun!
Did you read the piece though?
@KevinShau That neither addressed my point nor made one
@KevinShau NYT
Pool won an award that was given out to a Ke$ha(musician) fan club.(The Shorty)
@KevinShau 2/2:
He even testified before Parliament on this

"This is ""slippery slope"" fallacy AGAIN"
@KevinShau 1/2: on C-16
Peterson claimed that adding gender identity to the protected classes could possibly
@KevinShau I am not going to argue if that is right or wrong
@KevinShau It is not good.  So Peterson is right that it is a bad movie
@KevinShau Also
@KevinShau Something rooted in sexism
"@KevinShau Neither was saying that Feminists support the rights of Muslims because of their ""unconscious wish for brutal male dominance"" nor"
it's good that you consumed the liquor instead of letting some Indian steal it(especially after crying honorary native american!  Pocohantus much?
@KevinShau https://t.co/uyZXVyW4G8
"Also I find his defense against racism that he is ""Honorary tribe member"" hilarious."
"@KevinShau You touted him as ""award winning"""
@KevinShau https://t.co/tIxxid9RVX
Also a great piece by Petardson approved Source
"@KevinShau To quote the same sources Peterson uses: ""Dr. Peterson is a sexist. . . However"
@KevinShau But Epic Meal Time rival
"@KevinShau ""nor must of his supporters are alt-right."""
#NAME?

My sources win Pulitzer prizes
@KevinShau I don't recall Tim Pool arguing that opinion pieces are the downfall of media.  This is an opinion piece you are attacking.
@KevinShau Peterson argued that the Disney movie Frozen is propaganda which isn't relevant but is pretty hilarious
"@KevinShau Peterson also argued that women support the Muslim plight because it matched with their ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination'"
@KevinShau This coincidentally is in an interview with Peterson from Time magazine. Slippery slope present and highlighted https://t.co/fkfjyNgtz9
@KevinShau Your using Pool repeatedly as an example of an intellectual is laughable. He won an unrecognizable award(same award was given to Epic Meal Time and Justin Bieber)
He also was named Time person solely for live streaming an event on twitter. Hardly prestige earning
@KevinShau It's an analysis based in fact. 
Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon
@KevinShau Most of the alt right agrees with him.
I do my research well
@KevinShau https://t.co/QoRJ0L9JdL
Please do read this
@KevinShau Peterson is sexist and at the very least probably islamophoboc. He argues using common logical fallacies
@KevinShau Peterson preys on disaffected young men
@KevinShau Peterson is arguing conflicting points with conflicting data and poor sources
@KevinShau He sources Reddit
@KevinShau I'd also question the Forced Monogomy Peterson proposes as a solution. That seems a lot like forcing a lifestyle choice

@GoGoKarlMarx You're back on twitter?
@KevinShau I'll take time to look at the rest
@KevinShau Government should not discriminate
@KevinShau Yet Trump did
@KevinShau Historically this has always been the case
@KevinShau So let's allow people to be discriminated against?
Fix the politics
@KevinShau Again
Don't say oh well it confuses me so let's let these people suffer discrimination
@KevinShau So

Instead of working to define these terms
@KevinShau That's is a false analogy
@KevinShau When has that happened? And don't mention Canada because we have discussed that isn't what the law is
@KevinShau Can you provide evidence? I'd argue it was on the decline slowly and the legislation speeded up the decline
@KevinShau A transgender person is an individual
@KevinShau Though most do
@KevinShau Most biological males also identify as straight
@KevinShau Another humans gender identity affects you in no wsy. Forcing them to narrow theirs down to once of two is unnecessary and wrong
@KevinShau You're thinking of biological sex
@KevinShau I trust a group of well informed and educated people more than the mass population.
@KevinShau Shaming a gender is worse
@KevinShau Slippery slope fallacy
You aren't legislating subconscious
@KevinShau And yes I am aware it is an oversimplification but I feel it helps
@KevinShau And that is outside the rest of the facts in that case
@KevinShau Ignore the science. A woman you work with had an abortion
@KevinShau There is a large difference between a sage space and a non hostile work environment.
Spewing blatant sexist garbage is a hostile work environment
@KevinShau Damore was
@KevinShau This video was to show the bosses of parents and the idea that we subconsciously place gender roles on others
@KevinShau Nobody wants to force someone to act in a way that doesn't match their gender
@KevinShau Then you should do basic research

@KevinShau James Damore got fired for being an idiot
https://t.co/0iZPuPV2nG
@KevinShau https://t.co/Ly27jPg6aa
@KevinShau I wouldn't argue that we need to destroy traditional gender roles
@KevinShau I'll link you to monkeys throwing shit at eachother too
@KevinShau Traditional gender roles are breaking free naturally already
@KevinShau I agree on the first half
@KevinShau We have to make those careers friendly to women. Look at the percentage of women who report abuse in STEM fields
@KevinShau Because from a young age women aren't pushed into the idea that being housewives is a fine goal? That women should cook
@KevinShau Women are more likely to do housework
@KevinShau I'm on my phone in a car but that is stuff you can google or I can google for you when I'm near my desktop
@KevinShau When those are accounted for a large gap still exists. The exact portion of percent is just Semantics.
@KevinShau The gap takes into account most of those factors if not all. Even when accounted for
@KevinShau I’ve watched his videos on the wage gap
@KevinShau Let's not Use the term journalist so frivolously

@magpies_history I was 12. Went with my Dad. All standing behind the goal when it went in. I wish I could have appreciated then how special it was. You can see me and my dad in the crowd when he scored.
@Zeitgeist24_7 If oz spend the next year losing he will be welcomed back with open arms. Bancroft will have to hope they don’t find a decent opener!
As an England cricket team fan it’s time to let the Aussies get on with it and focus on why we haven’t won away since 2016.
@Zeitgeist24_7 Yes. I did start to wonder if the world had gone a little crazy at this point. There does need to be some perspective. He hasn’t killed anyone
@Zeitgeist24_7 And why did they say it was sticky tape and not sandpaper? Did they think this sounded better?
And as a newer country their sporting achievements gives them a place on the world stage. They are also very patriotic and defensive of their country. This will have hurt proper Aussie cricket fans.
I should add I love Australia
@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasn’t that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.
Things don’t go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!
Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasn’t involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..
@Zeitgeist24_7 Have to wait 10 years for the autobiographies to know more!
@Zeitgeist24_7 Sure
Different to 2011. England players couldn’t relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising it’s harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.
Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players heads
I don’t understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergate
Only Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in control
All the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..
On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived
@kevina364 He is their KP.
He only cares about no1 and maybe the abuse had finally got to him. I know I’m supposed to hate Smith but I just feel sad
Care if the ball swings? He’s not bowling and none of the abuse has been personally aimed at him. Let’s say Warner did come to him with this plan surely telling your Captain and teammates is going to help your standing more esp when it was Warner idea! Warner is the KP of Aus..
My #sandpapergate thoughts for anyone who cares. I don’t get why Bancroft did it if it just came from Warner? Bancroft is new to the team
I really want Macc to get promoted. That is a horrid league to get out of and they have one of the smallest budgets and most of the club is run by fans. I loved my time at the club. #mtfc
.@GerritForward I didn’t see last promotion season. How does this team compare? 97/98 team were very special. They had such confidence it felt like we would never lose again

.@rickygervais loved your stand up on Netflix. Next tour tell Americans how our country went into meltdown over KFC not having chicken. Headline news and the best vox of a woman screaming that she had to go to Burger King 😂
@aaronsidwell So sorry to hear what happened. My two cats are old and are house cats except for the odd wander in the garden. I’m glad because so many ppl don’t even care.
@timbb my only memory of you living at home was you breaking a big glass garden ornament and hiding it down the side of the garage and making us promise not to tell Mum and Dad!

Steve Smith is an Aussie
He wears a baggy cap
And when he saw some sticky tape
He said I'm having that...
He gave it…
@Johnnysmalls78 I’ve told my dad he will need a bag next time if he still insists on loo breaks. Also being 70 is no excuse to not run to rides when the park opens!
@Lagaan_cricket Habit? I think they should have taken them off when speaking
@Johnnysmalls78 Drinks breaks?!? No then people want the toilet!! I recently found out some ppl go to Disney for fun and not to plan and then march round! Some people!
@Johnnysmalls78 Come on holiday with my family and you would be grateful for your in laws. We tour Disney world like a military operation with partners just told what time to be ready in the morning 😂
I don’t feel sorry for Bancroft especially after the way he acted re Bairstow but let’s be honest if he got told to do this he either risked his career or did as the older kids told him to do! Using him would have been a calculated risk as the least valuable player #savaus
@Johnnysmalls78 Can you blame them?!?
When u and your sibling tell your parents it wasn’t you and they believe you. Then when they find out it was you! https://t.co/orqzEKXMy1

Who are now a major rival rather than pre Potter when they were a secondary attraction alongside seaworld. Still if you do decide to stop going I thank you as I might be able to go “off peak” and not find lines for the peoplemover 😂😂 #wdw #disneyworld
Making more money it’s another way to try and stop people hiring a car and heading off site. Just like magical express and Disney springs. They want you to spend all your time including shopping and dining onsite and not head to I drive to eat or worse head to universal
Re #wdw charging for overnight parking. They are a clever and astute company
Notts have dropped to 4th and league 2 is so tight. All teams are dropping points. I think we will go up automatically or not at all (we would lose to Mansfield in the playoffs!!) and I want that more right now than I want to wake up and find I’m at Disneyworld! #ncfc #notts
As my bio points out I don’t just discuss cricket so onto other subjects!!!
@thelassheather Oh and the ppl who think if England lose that your holiday must have been terrible. Sure I wanted England to win in Oz but I didn’t spend the evening crying alone in my room! In fact except the funny moments I forget the cricket!
@thelassheather I like it when fans talk about dropping players like we have players better than Cook and Broad etc just waiting to play!
@AdelaideBarmies We also have areas with 2nd gen Indian children who do love the game (huge numbers turn out when India are in town) but we have had little success in finding players
@AdelaideBarmies I do think football having huge academies sweeping all sporty boys up at 6 is bad for all other sports too. Parents suddenly think their 6 yr old is the next Ronaldo and other sports aren’t even thought about
@TheAshes1011 That draw was amazing. I saw England win the ashes at trent bridge but that draw was the most tense I’ve ever been at a cricket game!!
@daznccc Bet Broady was happy about that one
@ZaltzCricket So we didn’t even set any more records?!?
@AdelaideBarmies Agreed. Sky have been good for the game but we need some t20 at least on regular tv
Nothing else compares. NZ is a tiny population compared to Eng and it’s not their number 1 sport. So yes we should expect to beat NZ and if we aren’t doing we need a massive rethink as a country about how we keep cricket as our no2 sport. #NZvsEng
No longer seem to. It’s not just a middle class sport like in England and they don’t have football academy that snap up any sporty 6 yr old and make their focus just football. But when I lived in NZ I rarely met a Kiki who cared about cricket
Some thoughts for what they are worth... When I lived in Oz I *got* why they were good at cricket. Head to any park and see little kids playing the game
England cricket assisting me in getting ready for England football this summer. False hope followed by reality!
@breadus That’s the Mansfield attitude we love!

@FulhamJon To go back to that room the night before the Brisbane test when I thought we might have a good winter 😂 I don’t miss the cricket or acoustic oasis covers!!
@TomJHaylett Yep and sure there are changes but there are some of the same players. Must be mentality.
@FulhamJon My biggest concern is the lack of players coming through.
@TomJHaylett It’s like it’s the week after the Sydney test.
@DutchBirdKate @waihekeisland @TheBarmyArmy Nice of England to give you more sightseeing time!

@Minhosa27 For them to have real chance at other sport
@Minhosa27 Also noticed in oz (ok if was summer there) that there were kids everywhere just playing cricket
@Minhosa27 Yeah fresh eyes! Im worried about new T20

5 nieces and 2 nephews and not one interested in football let alone want to follow #notts Nephews came once
When I saw her this week I pointed out her ripped jeans had holes in and offered to sew them up and told her that her crop top must have shrunk in the wash. She glared at me

Positives in my life. It makes me ungrateful and then makes me beat myself up for being ungrateful and most of all it makes me scared of making mistakes in a way I have never been scared before. #depression
Achieved and I haven’t. It makes me forget all my amazing travels
My depression isn’t a black dog (my cats would never forgive me!) but is a dementor. It sucks the happy memories from me

@twomuch77 I’m not saying this is the answer but like drug laws we can’t have a sensible conversation without people screaming about it.
@twomuch77 Well in America for example you can go direct to a specialist rather than through a GP. in Australia you can see a GP 24/7 but you pay for the privilege. We need to look at all ideas and be open to change
What tv shows do you watch again and again? Mine is the office (American version!) god knows how many times I’ve seen it!
@twomuch77 I don’t think it’s just about money. It’s about changing the whole way we use the service. I’m not necessary against money being raised through taxation I just think it’s an issue that no one can have an adult conversation about without ppl screaming that we are moving to US
@twomuch77 Exactly! We need to have that conversation. We have to pay more one way or another!

Something good about tonight... I started watching Notts in 1991 when I was 10. Me and my dad going to every home game and the odd away game together. Having that time with my dad was amazing
Fair play to Notts fans who sang all game. That mentality isn’t always there in football anymore and it was great to see #notts
Sometimes I feel sad that my best years of watching Notts was when I was 9 - 14 and didn’t really appreciate it but then I remember we have fans who have only ever seen us in the bottom 2 divisions after years of watching us #notts

Oh and remove the fine for taking children out of school during term time (up to year 9) Leave it to the discretion of the school. The current policy shows little understanding how important family time is and what it is like for the average person to get time off during summer
10. Overall strive to be the party of a fairer society
9. Stop talking about the internet like something you have just discovered / been told about . Everytime I hear a Tory MP discuss the internet I cringe.
8. Might seem petty but remove subsided bars / food from parliament. We need to regrow trust in our MPs and things like this just wind people up!
7. See prison as a way to rehabilitate rather than simply punish
6. Ban the export of live animals and increase the punishment for people found to be mistreating animals (life time ban should be the norm!)
5. Consumer rights need to be updated and tightened as we allow too many online rogue traders that you wouldn't see in your local shopping centre.
4. Re look at the system for house buying
3. As less people can afford to buy look at better rights for both tenants and landlords. Good landlords and tenants need to be treated better and rogue landlords should have banning orders / more severe punishment.

@Johnnysmalls78 Oh and call the club every 10 mins from 10am asking if the game is still on even though its 10c and it hasnt rained in a week! Also if you want to complain club staff love it if you find their private fb and message them early on Sunday with your complaint.
@Johnnysmalls78 complain that there is a line to get a pie at half time! Oh and that getting out the ground was a fire hazard!
Please have patience with staff and new fans today. We want them to come back! #notts

@blnode @tomtomwilkins @Official_NCFC @FanExperienceCo How about letting away families with children under say 13 use the family stand. Away days can be hard for families. Otherwise a segeragated area in the away support that is no swearing

I tried to find joy in Notts winning and still couldn’t. I just felt nothing.
But it was too soon. Without being dramatic I felt like I had PTSD when I stepped inside the ground and was paranoid that ppl looked at me
The Munto era passed me by and I could no longer find any join in the club. If was alien to me. When the Trews arrived I tried to go back
From the ground. I was left with depression and a sense of having lost my football club. Something which I had loved from the age of 9.

@kevina364 And the reason was?

New mug. Who did? First new mug in the new apartment. No drama llama allowed. New rule.  @ Portland
Fumiko is super jazzed about her new comforter. It was the last one at Target. Now I need to find the sheet set for it. We also just met our neighbor and she seems really nice!  @ Portland
Well the interwebz is already set up. The box was waiting for us when we brought some stuff over. It was pretty easy to set up.
Gun laws should have changed with the first school shooting. But here we are again
I fried up some white corn tortillas. I put lettuce and guacamole on mine. Sascha put turkey pepperoni and cheese on one and Fumiko put some Cheetos in one. What. 😹

Poor Fumiko. She is not doing well about our potential move. She came home crying from school and said she had a mental breakdown about moving. 😭 I think not knowing when is what is really upsetting her. We don’t know when a spot will open up and when it does we have 10 days.
