MARVEL GET ON IT
Clearly I m so in love with my girlfriend that her face has to be what I see everyday  lol  
Before the night is  
If I can replicate today s pump before walking on stage  no one stands a chance 
An adult  Lol 
I think Belen is going to love what I have planned for her birthday   
My girlfriend is a godsend  Literally been there with my thru everything  took my to my doctors appointments  helped push me to seek help  And instead of running  she stayed with me when she didn t have to  Love her to death 
Ain t that the truth    
A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar II syndrome  I ve made such great progress being in control of my emotions and manic episodes thanks to my doctor  Literally have never had such a clear mind my entire life  It s been fucking amazing 
I m gonna hate everytime Harden does his little step into the shot to pull the foul 
Bruh why the Pelicans so dirty tho 
Blu ray or UHD disc  You won t regret it  Mine looks amazing in ultra HD 
Those are sick  How much are they 
Fuck  Infinity War is a must see 
Imagine if that was made real  the things people who lost the ability to walk or was born without the ability would be infinite  They could see what it feels like to walk or rehabbing an injury would be safer and faster 
After watching Shazier walk out  I think I ve figured out what my life s work will consist of  This may sound stupid  but Stark created a walking robotic apparatus for Rhodes at the end of Civil War 
I ve done 3 shows  Each one not doing well  thought I took them seriously but in reality  I did not  This time  I went balls to the wall  and its all coming together 
Looking forward to moving and going back to school 
It just gets worse from there bro 
I feel like me and gonna cry while watching Infinity War  10 years in the making man  10 years  that s like going to school and then graduating to leave for college 
If y all got time  watch Collateral Beauty starting Will Smith  If you don t got time  make time  You won t regret it 
   
These ab cramps will be the death of me 
Hell yeah  miss yah ass  I m going down there in June to finalize the spot 
Ayeeee  I m moving to Long Beach in July 
You coming home  
     
Of course it was your shit   
It annoys me when I see people at sporting events like basketball or football games wearing dress shirts or sport coats  Especially when they wear the free shirt over the dress shirt  Like bruhhh  just take it off 
Belen just surprised me with tickets to Kendrick s Championship Tour  What did I do to deserve so an amazing woman   Fuck man  I love her so much 
When I see people say  I need a trainer  hit me up   Nah  that s your first mistake  You need help  You seek help  No trainer wants to train someone who is too lazy to get up and do something as simple as asking 
Blue burst does melt but not every player knows how to use correctly 
Honestly  baseball brawls are so much more satisfying than those pussy basketball fights  Lol 
We out 
Dieting and prep sucks  but the fact that at this point  11 weeks out and I look just about the same the day of my last show excites the fuck out of me 
17th day straight lifting and doing cardio fasted  Taking this prep 1000  more seriously  I want a sword 
Bigger  Better  Stronger  Don t get caught sleeping  My injury was only a minor setback  June 30th  the masterpiece shall be revealed 
I think they should be coming out with a black one soon 
Glock 19X 
This year is just insane  So many moves all over the league 
My PTs and doctors at Rehab call me Rich  like I ve been here for so long already  it s too late to correct them  I just go with it now  Lol 
    
You are mistaken sir  she actually does like you 
Guess it s only a Jultina and Tomez trip    
Tfti
These refs need to stop being so soft  Ball hit the Drays shoulder  he didn t hit it himself  and give him a tech for saying it hit his shoulder  BS call red 
In the jungle there are monkeys and gorillas  Monkeys are small and agile  gorillas are massive and strong as fuck  You re a fucking gorilla so stop jumping around like a monkey and you won t get injured    Uncle Rob    
NBA refs are soft as fuck  Like all teams are suffering from refs acting like a bunch of bitches 
Never said a time  All I said they tweeted it would release tonight and minutes later after halftime it released 
Dude I saw the tweet  But didn t realize minutes later they would release   
That Eli and OBJ dancing commercial was fire  lol 
Took a fat L this morning trying to get the Cortez Kenny s    
 
My favorite wrestler growing up  Goldberg  is on The Flash     
All fucking Casey s fault  Lol 
Having to put my move on hold  pushing back school  pushing back my competitions  risking not being able to compete for a Pro Card  it s killing me  But it s all in God s hands right now 
       
What  A  Fucking  Game 
Only Alejandro can come out tonight  Lol 
This injury is depressing as fuck 
My girlfriend is such a blessing  Without her  these past few days would ve been hell 
How my 2018 has started  
Everyone over here talking bout the earthquake  I m just like  is my jar of Nutella okay  
Bitch  You haven t even gained any weight from what I see 
That shit takes you to a whole new world cuzo  Lol 
Power ranked 15th  And ranked 14th offense in the league at 5 10    the future is looking quite bright for the 49ers 
Pray for me    lol  
It s a scary thought  knowing that our QB was the backup for a legit GOAT  Let that sink in  he learned from the best  So it s not surprising how well he s leading the 49ers in such a short time 
Got 2 really tickets for the 49ers game tomorrow for sale  In the 100 sections  Any takers 
Return of the Dick
Let s go Miami  Throw up the U 
Let me tell you  last weekend in LA  I felt so out of place  It was for sure a huge culture shock for me  I m used to a diverse atmosphere  Out there  I felt like I had eyes coming from everywhere  But I can t wait to move out there 
Let me tell you this  if you have haters  you are doing something right  Don t get mad  Embrace the haters  They are mad cause they don t got it like you  They want to be you  They want what you have  A smile is a bigger slap to them than anything 
    
look at my last tweet and tell me you feel my pain bro 
Why is CoD WWII so fucking difficult   Like so complicated just to upgrade weapons and shit  Bring back Modern Warfare style of play 
Nah that s the whole HoS fam  Lol  We all have had to force a shower on yo ass 
Ayyyyy my hair is almost long enough to slick back again  Why am I so juiced for this  
People hate me cause they think I m an asshole  I m not an asshole  I just tell it how it is  No sugarcoating from me 
Hey guys someone well known and respected died a horribly tragic death but let me just quickly milk his death by shitting all over him for having different political viewpoints  
Juice world  gt  Shakespeare
Not even a joke
Yeah but have you heard of juice world 
You gotta go sorry
You re really cool and this take is making you out to be a really intelligent and empathetic person
Do it
Smh   is this all white people have to complain about    
I did not need to know
My son has returned from war god I love him 
This slimebag thought he could hide this shit by protecting his shit  Nope  Not today 
Delete this you spineless inhuman puss filled blister of a parasite 
I haven t really teared up this much since David Bowie  Total biscuit was a huge inspiration to me and inspired me to want o write and create  I m utterly devastated  If there s a heaven definitely deserves a spot up there  Just a kind and honest man 
Holy fucking shit   total biscuit is dead   I don t even know what to say  I m really crushed  Fucking hell he fought so hard  May his soul rest
What s the last movie game song whatever the  fuck to make you cry 
Hell yeah
Hulk
wanna show me your crusty tiny cock
I don t really have an opinion  I just saw the opportunity for a good meme
H
 Juice world is just as talented as kendrick Lamar 
despicable
I thought these people died out in the 80 s 
This post is so wholesome 
Guess they didn t like it

Yes
Hannah baker more like Hannah back that ass up sweetie
Sent ya one
Cool now add me back on discord cunt
Let me clarify  I like most of these characters but my god the people who obsess over these characters are the WORST
I love this
Ye  just not obsess over them
I go to a public school  Everyone I know there watches it
Every fuckboy that has hbo watches it puppy
Imagine how less impactful the rape scene from the girl with the dragon tattoo would have been if they put a warning before the movie started that  WARNING  MOVIE CONTAINS SCENES OF RAPE AND VIOLENCE 
Here s a hot take  I think trigger warnings are honestly pretty pointless and can ruin the immersion of a show  If you really want to avoid getting super upset just do some simple fucking research  It s not the creators job to cater to you
Good art and all but the cat ears doesn t make you any less of a furfag
I can t believe we live in a world
What the fuck
Only if you quit being a furry
No
What did you do
He can suck a fatty
You re done for
Dm me
I m legit studying filmmaking
Hi
Trust me I know people
Yes let s applaude for something that was easily achieved and took writers no time to really think out  It s easy as shit to slap on labels just to sell tickets  Be amazing at the writing and direction  not the fact that   oh wow  a minority is here  Time to throw millions  
Fuck you re right
If you catch anyone who has an obsession over any of these characters I can guarantee without a doubt that they are just some 15 year old spastic who says they  don t fit in with the other kids  
QUIT PICKING THE BEAR YOU FEINDS
I don t know if this is a hot take or not but the Grand Theft Auto games offer some of the best satire and social commentary in any video game
Here s my take  If you re Going to get an abortion do it ASAP  After a few months fetuses begin to develop their nerves and as a result begin to feel pain 
I wish
BUUUIMP
Good tweet
Honestly the newest and probably last song by little peep just shows the potential he had to be something great  It s really a shame 
Papa smurf Kevin abstract Tobias from arrested development
Johnny cash slaps
Look up star fox porn if you want some context
I m sorry for this
A modern Godzilla would just be someone s fursona living out their hidden fetish of being giant and crushing innocent people with their feet

You there all weekend 
See you there 
Definitely shout if you see me 
I just bought a Saturday Ticket   So I will see you there  Most likely as Harleen  Yayyyyy noods
Awkward moment when I recognise two of the photographers who haven t asked    
Guess who will be coming to awkwardly say hi on Saturday now that she has a ticket    
Yaasssss
Fanku   and yeah I m partial to Harleen  And yeah I was thinking that too tbh but eh ya never know   
Turns out I m able to do to on Saturday    hype What should I wear  Harleen or Juleka  Also  should I bring my 7x5 prints to sell for  3      
Thank you sweet   
If anyone fancies cheering me up   I m so stressed out    I hate my job but can t afford to quit      
Thank you all for the great stream    Viewer milestone 2 7k reached     Nearing 2 milestones    250 followers   10 subs Join me tomorrow 8pm UK time for another stream  
  LIVE NOW  Aiming for that 250 followers milestone  Jetpack Joyride on    
I fail to see how you think a choice is equal to killing the elderly  Involuntary euthanasia isn t a thing  That s just murder  But then the choice to be euthanised isn t there either so maybe you should think about that cause first 
Wait I thought you said an unborn foetus was a person too  Isn t that three  Sacarsm  Their lives have not begun yet  they are unable to live outside the womb  And once Ireland is able to provide that care without judgment and to a sufficient level  then maybe your point is valid
Once again  we are not killing babies  And frankly  before they have been born  the mother s life should still be more important  The amount of kids in care is ludicrous  and the suicide rates in foster kids is high as hell 
There are already over 7 6 billion people in the world  There are finite resources on this planet  Don t try defending your cause with overpopulation of the planet  Also  I don t think you have the correct statistics to back up that claim 
Somehow I think all the kids in care  abused by their parents etc etc would beg to differ 
So women deserve for their lives to be ruined by a child they did not want  cannot care for  is a product of abuse rape  severely disabled  cannot afford  risks the mother s wellbeing long term or short term  I think most women would prefer the choice  They don t have to take it
   
We are going round in circles love  I would rather have the choice to terminate a pregnancy that I do not want  there are still rules in England with the option to abort  The moment you willingly put a unborn foetus before a living woman  you ve condemned another life to misery 
Yeah I m planning on a Corsair keyboard  And yeah I use my laptop screen when streaming  Again this screen is borrowed
Lol god no 
The headset was a present  the mouse is Grant s  I can t find mine  
Whether it is likely or not those few women should be given the choice  And seeing as I live in England  where thankfully  abortion is legal  it really does not become an expectation  It s still a damn hard decision but give a woman a choice 
Intestines are developed outside the body and twist in  Definitely not all in place by then  There s no use in an undeveloped lung  It s like saying uncooked chicken is still suitable to eat  And what about protection from an abusive family due to being born of rape force 
Oh I wonder what that means   
I think those positions are all filled a while back  No matter  You guys at Kupo in Birmingham 
Without a wristband     I wish  
Making me sad that I don t have tickets   
Managed to have 5 minutes outside in the sun    
Two losses  I m so sorry   I m glad you ve been somewhere that does give you the option and care you need  
No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby    It would poison the mother if it wasn t removed  And so the mother  the VICTIM  should have to suffer instead 
I think you best read up a little more  Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy  
Contraception isn t 100  effective  Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy  But you ll risk the well being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked  It doesn t have the organs to survive alone   
I m sorry you had to go through that  The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman 
Thanks for informing me on how a human is created    But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks  That is no life  I suppose you re someone who believes contraception is wrong too 
Yet women aren t all given help  You re not killing a baby    It s not alive until it is born  until then  it is a foetus  I fail to see how a child born from rape or into poverty wouldn t leave a  trail of devestation  too  Let women make their own choice about their bodies   
What about a mother who was raped  or living in poverty  who s life is at risk through not having an abortion 
I m not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn  It happens so often      since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own 
Thank you sweet  I keep being relieved I m not but sad I m not  
That s true  I probably would end up collapsing and without Grant to help me and notice when I m going I would probably freak a bunch of people out   
Tho when my mum asked me if I was going I kinda felt sad  I haven t missed MCM May in years 
But on the other hand  I wasn t even thinking about con until this week and I m not as hyped for it as I once was 
It annoys me that I should have been able to afford MCM this weekend but fate had other plans and I have to focus on bills and stuff first   
I only play it with old school friends now for a laugh and only play arcade or quickplay  Then I can hide from the toxicity  
I think I played 2 seasons then gave up  Throwers and afk on comp  
This is why I don t play Ranked Overwatch anymore
Jesus Christ man 
Also if anyone s noticed  the mouse pad is a photo of my Maya cosplay by     Christmas present from my mum  along with a t shirt with my face on it    
Lol are you okay so many responses  
Nahh just a potato
I say kid    When I was younger 
I used to do that as a kid  
Oh it is actually  I ll have a look 
Mechanical is better but more expensive  I am looking at getting a Corsair K55 RGB  Just to get me started 
My current desk is my childhood one  I need a deeper one tbf 
That s so pretty  
It s a spare too   it s not nice to use tbh
I definitely need one  
I m actually borrowing this one from my partner  He has the other  Im using this to make my mini laptop easier to use    As my main laptop just packed up   
Alright sassy pants
Would love one   Also just noticed you re based down the road from me  
Anyone wanna help improve my setup  
Pahahah funny
Nope
I m disappointed in you

I also just wanna say that I have been keeping this a secret because I was embarrassed I guess  Like I m normally a bubbly  shy  nerdy  hard on the outside but soft on the inside type of human  And to go from being your best self to completely losing who you are  Damn that s hard
Thank you so much love  
I m not doing this for attention  I m doing this because I just realized how shitty it is to go through this and I want people who are also going through this to know that they are not alone 
Thank you so much love  you have no idea how much that means to me   
Also just in case anyone is wondering my anxiety is about failure and not being good enough 
Add is attention deficit disorder  Or more commonly known as ADHD  but I don t have the hyperactivity 
Hey guys I know most of y all won t care but I just want you guys to know that the reason I ve been so mia is because I m mentally not at a good place  I got diagnosed with ADD and I have really bad anxiety

I only clap back at people who demonstrate that they suck  I generally ignore chill people doing their own thing or minding their business  The celebration of hubris and crass stupidity is more offensive to me than a person s political position
Actually being really smart is one of the reasons I feel justified in being an asshole    to arrogant  ignorant people who don t deserve power or influence over me
 just because you re smart doesn t mean you have to be an asshole    somebody who resorts to cussing out the enemy to balance out their own logical fallacies on nearly a daily basis on twitter dot com

 Drum roll  Please welcome the lovely Mandy to the Twittersphere people  
Husband is complaining that we have the same thing to eat everyday of the week  that thing being non curry

Right now they should come to Arun Yacht Club Open Day  Boats  bar  BBQ  
We even have a fire engine  What are they planning to cook on the BBQ  Arun Yacht Club 
The bar staff are friendly  Arun Yacht Club open day today  
Bar s open  
That should say BBQ btw 
Arun Yacht Club all set for the Open Day  There is bunting  There is BBC  There is sunshine and boating  
Chunks of time set aside for what s a priority  remembering that stuff that is important but not urgent becomes urgent if you leave it 
Tritto 
Done  Seriously offensive 
 Nobody will ever end poverty  not even Bono   Brilliant 
Citizen of Nowhere on Radio 4 now  Do not miss it 
Looks fab   right up your street   
That s an interesting question  you re right  perhaps I don t know  What is a logo for 
Wow  Well that told me  Thank you to everyone that told me how wrong I was yesterday  Good to see that Scouting is in such good hands 
The symbolism that is in the World Scout Badge has been stripped out of the logo 
With all of the symbolism stripped out  Bland  How sad 
Last year it was mindfulness and AI  The year before it was engagement an neuroscience  I think there is a committee in Switzerland that comes up with the criteria

It s I wonder what West Sussex Schools are doing to support their pupils who have been diagnosed with anxiety  depression or stress 
Should I be watching Eurovision or Britain s Got Talent 
Then bloomin well go for it  Get them eyes closed

Superb day  
You re not making any friends here Guido 
Oh my  Thank God for random strangers 
Battling with an assignment  Send help

I for one would like to read that Tony 
Before I go though  everyone who has said on here  this is a great question  I need to think about that  you re already doing brilliantly  Gone  Mrs Webb has left the building 
Got to go    Catch you later 
Could we set up a group   possibly as part of   to check each other s work somehow  Would this work 
Possibly   but rarely I would guess  my bias  
Anyone  
This is such a challenge to me  Anyone got a personal policy practice of how they address this  What steps do people take to light up their bias   Conscious or unconscious  
Another slant is  how do we address the effects and implications of our unconscious bias   
Wondering what is doing right now   she has done some work in this field 
Be encouraged  most responses here have been  great question   I sense a willingness to explore 
And that  not admitting  is key to it 
Excellent q this morning  Hand up  I m not sure that I am  Looking forward to this  
Morning from Littlehampton

The official answer is that this livery is meant to be highly visible with the intention of slowing people down rather than catching them speeding 
Sadist    
 
Arr s pose
We had an ice cream van that came and sold individual cigs to kids  Different times      now it s cannabis and cocaine 
No wonder your kidleys are buggered  
Industrious    
I used to drink Holsten Pils from the bottle in a night club under a pub with the stickiest carpets and lowest ceilings ever      
Oh I remember snake bite which was diamond white and lager  
Nice  I liked taboo too 
I used to drink Malibu and pineapple  It tasted like sun cream     
I used to get given a pound a day for lunch  I got a Holland s pie  a bottle of Space Special  vile green stuff  and a packet of onion rings from the tuck shop  It cost 53p and I saved the rest 
My first proper job was on the checkout in Asda in 1989  I earned about a tenner a day  You could have one heck of a night out on a tenner 
Like police officers   
That s the idea   
Very good    I was thinking it looked like a 1920s ray gun  Maybe Nikola Tesla was involved 
New livery for speed vans in Lancashire  No really  I m not kidding  For once

Sorry  couldn t help it

it s so hard not to be sad like i don t know how else to be  it s not like i m choosing it either but i just don t know what makes me happy anymore  i remember a few years back i would get goosebumps and butterflies doing the things i loved but now i feel nothing 
thank you     
ayyyy 
except my best friends and julian  
i cried so much today  but i know people like you are going to help this world even if it s not drastically  but hey a bit of a change around here is good  I just want my mom back home and wish i didn t have tot choose between her and school my future  
a child never deserves to be separated like this from any parent  she doesn t have papers  amp  it sucks ass because she s such a great person  amp  i miss my mom so much it s been almost 3 years  amp  it hasn t gotten any better  i miss you mom  te amo  it sucks seeing her down like this  
s2 ep22 of greys anatomy ruined my makeup  a mom had cancer  amp  had had it for awhile  amp  never told her daughter  she tells her daughter by giving her advice for living with her aunt  amp  marriage  amp  children  she then said you ll be sad for awhile but don t be sad forever  that hit me 
i just did a 7 technically 11 minute workout so don t be surprised and or alarmed if i look skinner tomorrow
they say happiness lies within you  but i need my other half and she s halfway across the world and i need her so much  that s all i wish for rn is my mom  she s everything to me 
i just miss my momma so much  the fact that she misses so much for julian and me and my sisters breaks my heart  if i had it my way  she d be here and i d be complete again  i d kill to feel like that again  to feel happy 
i hear a mexican party in the distance and i wanna crash it and dance   
they didn t play j cole tonight  
i just want a boo to motivate and have concerts and cuddles with    
more  life 
in mexico  i was literally falling apart greatly more and more everyday  you never feel more exhausted until you get to the point where if you think you can keep your shit together till the next week and after that  the last few days there i literally couldn t do it anymore
karmas a bitch   
it s mother s day today in mexico and it sucks so much not being able to give my mom that hug and gift and everything i just miss her so much and i need her so bad
i ve listened to roy woods music before but i m just now listening to all of his albums and i think i m in love   
i want to hangout with so many people but 24 hours in a day ISNT ENOUGH
nobody talk to me tomorrow it s mexico s mother s day and i ll be depressed all day
yes me and my mom played around with the idea of being a stripper and i ain t even mad you gotta do what you gotta do  
I NEED TO MOVE OUT THIS TOWN AND FIND MYSELF A MAN THAT KNOWS HOW TO DANCE
What I don t understand is  is that she has the ugliest nails I ve ever seen  but yet she thinks she s some hot bitch lol she is ugly 
 ALSO MY BAND IS CALLED WATERPARKS LOL LOOK US UP   I love this man more than anything holy fuck
I feel this lmao
