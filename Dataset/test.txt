recognize the neurotic archetypes you subscribe to. once done don't stop there, embrace them. so tight their bones will crush

that thing where you spread tarot expecting unforeseen insights, and all you get is an amazing polaroid, so crisp it almost hurts
glimpsed myself, caught amidst queueing ghosts on glass. i looked pale, feeble, zero-dimensional. a black swan sketch unheld by any buddha.
the long forgotten tantra of spring being back, tensing unseen bow strings, going straight for throats
stranded in the wrong timeline. but why?
the allure of having ultimately attained a feeble, crude sentience. shattered upon wake.

sognò d'imbattersi in un cigno piccolissimo
a portmanteau of cofanetto sperlari and some horrendous curse, except you can't really spell it, 'cos unluckily there's no such word
countless episodes into darkness, check - yet, do brim sunlike
an increasingly common occurrence of oblivion at first sight
or, the curse of reverse akinetopsia, where towering swirls of movement forever lose the faculty to perceive you
the old lady, her stare rapt by alzheimer, smiling, whispering to her caretaker: 'he just married'. as i strolled by with my dog.
not that strange upon close inspection but a loop nonetheless. badly cut, lagging, popping through the boombox speakers when it cycles
most days actually reruns where only the observer has changed
focusing on the lay of the land but believe me, there's too much haze around
the strangest urge of circling things and instances as a vulture would, as age layering encrypted inside a tree
the only clear view - i titled a flickr picture years ago - is atop a mountain of dead selves.
the new you, possibly being a remake of the oldest, bambi eyed one, as far as selves go merging into ulterior superpositioning for a laugh
the new you, all snarky remarks and intended puns.
who knows if it knows where it's headed.
today was unreal.
but then, one thinks, aren't they all.
the tour de force process of enchanting for what you need rather than what you want. and yet the crunched apples, tasting sour and the same.
in the garden by the stairs. summer night fading onto aeolian disquiet. storm is next. malvasia nera through a glass riverlike.
gli occhi dardeggianti dismisura, pur empíti solo a belle addormentate. ma guardò oltre, poi,
the shiny new year, further evidence of how either the calendar or the self are figments of superstitions so old we don't grasp them anymore
a siren, going off in the distance, sounding like hope singing its past shelf date blues. roughly 9 am, full day ahead and you're welcome.
in the end, he thought, there is no me. but a smear of hiss and crackles where struggle used to be.
oozing confusion as cephalopods spill ink. residual images the grim zeitgeist of a slow summer.
listing snake charming, passionate obfuscation and dowsing for clues. in a resume.
went out into the world and nothing worked. ran no errands. devoting afternoon to sungazing and forget all about the rest.
stomping feet, the only explanation i'll offer from now on: i used my imagination.
finding myself increasingly unable to compile personal web profiles. a marker of what, exactly, eludes me.
thinking: i'm gonna wake up in a while.
back here after years. who are all these followers? did we step all this way through evolution & time just to have bots listening to us?
chided as well by unknown factors in even my imagination. less likely a nuance than mere phenomenic observation. mostly folding, outward.
leave a trace every once in a while. so that it gets to be known you ain't out of the world for good.
al limite si tratta solo di passare da una fase transitoria all'altra. 
a che pro battere ciglio?
back to the days when people used to ran things past their HGA hoping for a nod? the meanwhile has half a lunch splattered on the ground.
the day haltingly turning into one of those where everything is slow. thoughts, uplinks, wish fulfilments.
'we're sending feeble signals towards the sun'. thought of as a new title. following a strange docu. last night on the telly.
whoever you might be, please stop trying to reset my password. really.
no sunrise today?
the quantity of crap you could pass through customs with a little philosophy babble...
italics: i have no job, i have no home. i have nothing but rags and bones.
nonetheless stuck in an infernal engine of routines, though.
then finding it hard to fill all made promises over first black cup. but keeping still and centered nonetheless.
effective tomorrow, i'll be using it for short autobiographical narratives. which might, or might not, reflect actual events.
well, i said this stream was closed. it isn't. now bloody stop asking me to sell it or give it away for free. christ.
this twitter stream ends here, after a text file backup. i'm moving elsewhere unseen. fare you well.

guess i'll have coffee & a talk with the shrieking swallows out there
maybe 7 am is too early
three long months off the web. quite the horrendous experience.
tape recording bird chirping outside the window. staring at untended branching growth of invites. not acting, how tao.
the day kicking in in a morse code fashion, me not reacting at all.
brain-lethal mixtures of black coffee & gunpowder & strong sunlight won't bring me back from the dead apparently
back to work was eeeeek. twelve hours later i'm still floating in a mild shock puddle.
using sick leave and fever vapours to revamp almost abandoned websites. logoplasm.org has a shiny new look, so to speak. 't was about time.
webroutines are boring. that's a given, somehow underestimated. boring.
sick since days, wild fever and cranky bones. damn flu still co-opting me through another gray morning.
the tired status line: "home, knotting my brain" unchanged in months.
reading old article about the possibility that a satellite could open an extradimensional door. trying to fit it into the morning scenario.
omg there's a ghost on gtalk
somehow recalling soulseek's solar lodge bright days.
actually i'd love to have a slowchat window to return to. almost thinking of setting up something. and then i'd need people.
drawing. selfportrait with demon. the demon coming out kinda blurry.
downloading a season. wishing i could do the same for spring cos forthcoming winter already has me on the edge.
and the person who drinks it approximately lethargic
cold day meaning coffee going instantaneously cold, incidentally.
one hour into this cold day i already feel confused.
almost had a stroke, damn. i'll be ACCURATELY checking the volume knobs before hitting play, from now on.
over first coffee, understanding that sleep was just a marginal detail.
somehow still having problems with the dinosaur/astronaut thing.
so, new episode of my noisy podcast is finally up: http://tinyurl.com/28kakt
upping the new Cutting Powerlines episode at the speed of extinguished light. favela dsl's not helping a bit.
the sun climbs up the hill and kicks in. house full of light, feels like the Icarus ll screening room in Sunshine. good morning.
i want to be Man Among Wolves 2. but i realize Man Among Stray Dogs it's way more likely. and not that far in the future.
'There's two gangs at war with each other, and one of the gang leaders gets a book that tells him how to raise the dead'
now, what?
downolading The Quiet Earth, 1985 scifi. screencaps look so promising. 'A man wakes up to find himself literally alone in the world...'
i'm hearing seawaves, logging into remote servers. getting dead tired +++ by the second.
my last update: one month ago. i guess that nothing went on. heavy summer maybe.
just got a big pack of source sounds from a friend - a collaborative release being on the way, me being happy about that.
on two hours sleep. everything quite impressionistic & i'm not through the half of it.
birds outside sound like kosmiche musik.
realizing that i haven't updated or followed anything in days. been living in a noisy world of my own.
a moth just dived into my coffee cup. i was able to save it. not the coffee though.
just listened to the edit my friend Franz made of the session we played together on saturday night. good stuff, all of my mistakes cut out!
slowly grooving to ol' dj screw tunes. not looking forward to forthcoming shift. i need a doppelganger to do the work for me.
cruising bloglines, tumbling alongside. can't decide for a soundtrack to these lousy hours.
improv all through the night. felt good & maybe sounded so too. still feeling wasted though, oolong can't help apparently.
configured tiny ad-hoc network. it worked, & i'm now sipping coffee sitting amidst a data cloud.
there was a breach in my afternoon & already scarce free time completely leaked through. 
heading to work, cursing obscure divinities.
a qliphotic storm approaching. impromptu breaking of summer in halves. birds flying low, nervous dogs howling faraway.
everything getting temporarily difficult. no, difficult is not the word. 
slow and trembling, maybe.
over first coffee. testing some remixes i'm working on.
mail fights. didn't have one since ages. it still feels like shitty entertainment.
since twitter & jaiku are currently refusing txt from italy, i've set up my custom offsite solution. it's apparently working!
back home briefly, roughly check/check/check everything in sight, more things to do & more /me running away into the sun.
should grab all of these scattered paper scraps around me & turn them into a post. but it's too good a day to stay in. procrastinate!
booting through strong coffee & hypnopompic fragments. typing first alohas of the day with my fingers in the sun.
finally wrangled some sense into my jaiku page. leave it silent, mostly lifestreaming.
everything foggy white outside the window. birds chirping in the rain & hunters shooting. slip-cueing gnaoua + snake charming tunes.
(upon wake being this very unclear haze i'm floating into since, i think, a couple of hours)
slept like a mountain. feeling as one even upon wake too, which i'm quite convinced is not that good.
then, it's just a bad day for communication: had to delete & start over with my phone on twitter, & it's not f***ing working. grrr.
wondering if it will last. in the meantime: just discovered that Jaiku won't accept italian mobile numbers 'due to abuse'. wtf?
dropping the green cyclop icon & going for something more classic, like, a picture of me smoking.
discovering that almost a day of txt tweets never made it here. nice
damn shoggoth eating my musings. clear sign that i should be silent, maybe.
briefly hopping outside. to the sight of Arcturus, cig break, clouds gone & wind no more.
sitting at a coffeetable under alternate bouts of fierce sunlight. reptilianly rejoicing.
clouds sprawled as if spilled from somewhere. my mind incredibly lightweight. new day launching its own scripts.
shivering re: things that changed in the meanwhile. shortform weekend starting swiftly, ninjalike, will probably run in the same fashion
shutting down tabs. going for a swim in a lake of fire.
fast pacing thru aeschylus plays like a brain damaged terranova, trying to find a snippet my memory wont serve properly. might need it later
don't you hate it when your clothes go hiding in the home jungle & somehow you can't go out naked but you need to rush, damn
listening to sparrows on crack outside the window, backing up neighbours talking about paris
wondering if somewhere such a thing stands as a daily practice, the fruit divination, i mean. in no mood to google it.
opened my eyes to a cloudy day a little while ago. still having reveries of dreamland jungles & sliced fruit used for divination.
unwillingly conjuring images of heat melting my brain for good. scared of going to work in the afternoon. worrying re health.
damn heatwave apparently subsiding to a frail zephyr.
the drone of passing planes sound as somebody faraway, humming along.
is tumblr down? it would be the first time i see it happening. also, twitter page served with no headers...
listening to the audio track of King Kong, 1933. actually, natives screaming & pounding drums & dark growls coming from the forest. lovely.
then i went & got Curse of the Golden Flower in chinese. it's wonderful. i want to rip the audio & stick it in my player like, forever.
my first coffee being spiced up by the sound of snake charmers flutes & drums. way to go.
feeling like screaming & turning the moment into a wuxia movie. but i'll keep it to myself.
spent most of the night conjuring a beautiful day after. and it mostly worked so far.
freezing the moment & sliding sideways. 
steve reich x18 playing, stuck on a zeptosecond, sounding like a bell.
everything else should stop.
tiny dot just east of Arcturus, never noticed before. then gone. or maybe too many lamp posts. damn.
about to watch Ira Cohen's Invasion of the Thunderbolt Pagoda. finally.
scouting timelines. nothing good in sight short of supernovae exploding & turning earth into a planet of superheroes.
old Peter Carroll book stumbling in my hands. jumpily rereading, witnessing conceptual clusters resonating through the time past since.
pondering if i should finally use my youtube account to upload some videos
trying to organize the mess floating around me. a battle that won't see me winning, i'm sure.
popping up in im networks after months. 
lots of people waving aloha.
both new logoplasm releases are out (one of them being a free download, too) please check them out: http://haze.tumblr.com/post/1694639
speeding bikes shrieking like howler monkeys, too fast on too tiny a road. sun far from setting. soliloquy peaking like burning diesel.
@trishlet: yo! i'm very happy to find you on twitter :)
and she just said: 'this is the kind of thing we spear demons with'
plenty of labouring around the forthcoming Logoplasm releases. but everything should be done, now. i hope.
just registered a new domain. i'm going to use it on a new project. everything bathed in secrecy until then.
wrote a long mail to an old fried. glad that i was finally able to.
if only i could timelapse through most of my week & skip to the juiciest parts i'd be living in eternal mondays & perpetual late nights
watching Alberto Grifi's all night feature on Rai3, googling all about it in the meanwhile. way impressed.
back home. dreaming exotic food. feeling like a big yellow slug.
had this been a day off i'd be chanting ecstatic monologues. feeling all white noisey right now, instead. loads of warm light.
season drastically changed. two hours short of sunset  under a dustless sky, crisp clouds hoarding, all things shining.
discussing apocalypse over post-lunch coffee
i have a long bit of travelling ahead, just to cover a short distance. damn city jungle.
stuck stuck stuck. simplest sentences being the most untranslatable, i'm going for glossolalia evocation to find "multiple ways out"
just finished mastering the new Logoplasm recording. feeling quite satisfied, admittedly. a brief mailing now, to define release details.
everything went so quiet outside. finally catching my breath. feeling damn tired.
on labor day, it seems just proper that i have to leave now to go to work. i should edit myself out of this timeline.
there's a tiny ant walking on the laptop's keyboard. most of autobiographical events are really that irrelevant.
swift winds infiltrating the place, as if dancing to the loud percussions in the air.
and the telly, talking about 'towering zoomorph rocks' isn't obviously helping a tiny bit.
a sharp oak sliver sliced through my right thumb.
damn workplace keeps asking for human sacrifice. as if all time spent here wasn't already 
a jigsaw piece falling in place after sixteen or so years. i'm amazed. and in no way wiser, though.
listening to Siamese Temple Ball - one of the happiest records ever; you can almost sense the fun they had spilling from the speakers
found a facebook invite in my mailbox. somehow the thought of another network involvement gives me anguish wholesale. i think i'll pass.
playfully insulting coworkers, using id-specific, freshly tailored coarse vernacular acronyms. quite the (painfully) slow evening.
simpler times saw me photoblogging about sunsets like the ongoing one.
just recorded my three minutes to participate @ http://murmer.soundtransit.nl/playlists07.html
meanwhile, mixing down Terry Riley & Meredith Monk & various elses. 
the corollary: my house having poltergeists.
snippets of my days being spent in constant hopping. thoughts of signing off human condition & signing into simpler animal ones.
discovered something about my memory. also, glad it's still working.
oblique sunset rays through stained windows. soaked soil aroma lingering upon everywhere. pondering workplace abandonment.
raindrops like tiny needles. i'm getting selectively wet under a sky that looks neptunian.
strange moment, its ingredients being faraway agricultural machinery sounds & a phrasing so convoluted it could actually stops time.
just recovered 100+ erroneously deleted pictures from xd card. feeling relieved, two or three shots were actually nice.
spent first part of the day playing a drone so huge my nerves will be having visions for hours on end
